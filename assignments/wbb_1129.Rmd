#I identified several issues with the data during this process.
--> Mariona Garcia of Salem (WV) was not on team's official roster (she did play in 2 games, so is in the stats)
--> Neither ESPN nor the official Oakland roster listed height for Brooke Daniels.
--> Neither ESPN nor the official Oakland roster listed height for Eve Pardo.
--> Neither ESPN nor the official Oakland roster listed height for Lianna Baxter of Oakland.
--> Pomona-Pitzer is a special case and requires a different scrape become of the nature of the joint nature of the team. Here is the link to the roster: https://www.sagehens.com/sports/wbkb/2022-23/roster

# Foreign Nation Cleaning

Take the list of FIBA nations (https://www.fiba.basketball/rankingwomen) and make a list or dataframe of them, then compare that to the values in the `homestate` column generated above and populate a new column for country.

I'm using the above approach to scrape the FIBA nations and put them in a dataframe. My logic is then as following:
- Make a new column for country
- Populate this column with USA when there is a state identified by postmaster
- Then we are splitting the hometown_cleaned column by a ", " and taking the last item that was split by that function. This should give us either a state or a country, since country is listed as the last item in homewtown cleaned in the format "[city], [state], [country]", or "[city], [country]". Once we have this item we make it its own column "temp"
- There are a few popular cases where a player's state is listed as a province in Canada. Since there are so many of these occurrences, we will just set the country to Canada when this happens, similar to the U.S. logic
- Make the country uppercase to standardize
- Add popular nations that aren't in FIBA to the FIBA dataframe
- Use this FIBA dataframe as a list of countries to join on "temp"
- When the "temp" column had a successful join with the FIBA countries, we know that it's a recognized country. Then we will take this "temp" value and put it in "country. Otherwise we'll keep the current country value (Canada, USA)
- Then we'll drop the columns we don't need anymore
